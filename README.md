Dead or Alive: Schelling's Model of Segregation in Macbeth

Agent-based model: Thomas Schelling's model of segregation: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Segregation

This Python implementation is based on: https://colab.research.google.com/github/QuantEcon/lecture-python.notebooks/blob/master/schelling.ipynb

In this rendition, the agents will be influential characters in the play "Macbeth" by William Shakespeare. Since the Schelling model pits two factions against one another, the application in our class' original text, "Romeo and Juliet," was obvious: Capulets and Montagues. However, no two factions exist as obviously in Macbeth. However, thanks to the number of deaths that Shakespeare wrote into his play (see "Overkill in Shakespeare," www.jstor.org/stable/2870902), another option was to split the character lists into "dead" and "alive." Using the Schelling model, we can see how the characters self-segregate into dead and alive categories.

Not all characters are represented, as the character lists were adjusted to be equal in number to one another. The number of characters alive was greater than the number dead, meaning not all characters actually live at the end of the play were included in the "alive" category.
